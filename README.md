This projects attempts to create a tool that shows a breakdown of major cities around the United States. For each city, the map displays the estimated yearly cost of living, racial demographics by state, gender demographics by state, safety rating and quality of like ranking by city. The tool also allows you to input your yearly salary and living situation and determine approximately how much yearly disposable income you could expect to have. Such a tool can assist with numerous things, such as, life events like moving or job searching.
