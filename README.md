 This tool utilizes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Numbeo Database to create an interactive Tableau tool that compares the cost of living among some of the largest cities in the United States. This tool allows the user to input their yearly salary and select from a menu of housing options to determine which cities the user could afford to live in and approximately how much disposable income they would have left Currently, for each city, the map displays the estimated yearly cost of living, racial demographics by state, gender demographics by state, safety rating and quality of life ranking of the city. The use of highlights, filter, and parameters allow for an interactive user experience.
